# Liri-Node-App

The Liri Node App is a command line, media query app built.

It prompts users to pick from one of three options:

What would you like to search for? (Use arrow keys)
 Upcoming Concerts
  A Song on Spotify
  Movie Information
  
  -The concerts search calls the "Bands In Town" API using AXIOS, and returns all upcoming concerts, including date,time, and locations for the artist the user selects.
  
  -The Spotify search uses the spotify-node-api to search for individual songs, and returns the top relevant results to the user selection.
  
  -The movie search calls the IMDB API and returns selected movie, including Title, Year released, Ratings, and the Plot.
